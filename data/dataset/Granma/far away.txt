This time, This place
       D         B
Misused, Mistakes

Too long, Too late
        D               B
Who was I to make you wait
               
Just one chance
               F
Just one breath
         D                     B
Just in case there's just one left

I keep dreaming you'll be with me

B                  F
On my knees, I'll ask

Last chance for one last dance

'Cause with you, I'd withstand
        D                 B
All of hell to hold your hand

I'd give it all
               F
I'd give for us
          D                      B
Give anything but I won't give up
