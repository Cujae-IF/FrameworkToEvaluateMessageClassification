Letra de You Can't Stop Me :

Someone who's coming out to see the light of our destination
A maniac neurotic fool who wants to jump off the eye
How can you know that I'm the one who lives no matter of occasion
Another road another try
Where's the difference tell me why

You can't stop me
To love the world with all it's lies
Keep it to myself
Keep it to myself

You can't stop me
I'm close enough to kiss the sky
Keep it to myself again again

Why you coming out to see the road of less destination
I want look back for the shadows that fall off to me
We're trapped in a song so we'll lead them to hell or our salvation
Another you another me
Where's the difference telling me

You can't stop me
To love the world with all it's lies
Keep it to myself
Keep it to myself

You can't stop me
I'm close enough to kiss the sky
Keep it to myself again again

I'm just another broken up
Mess them up
Running to the eye (eye)
Running to myself
Broken up
Mess them up
Running to the cosmic ways
Running to myself
(2x)

You can't stop me
To love the world with all it's lies
Keep it to myself
Keep it to myself

Won't you stop me
I'm close enough to kiss the sky
Keep it to myself again again
again again

I'm just another broken up
Mess them up
Running to the cosmic ways

Letra de Pretty In Scarlet :
Pretty in scarlet
So pretty in scarlet

We slept a while
to turn it up and get it off our minds
i slept a while
to get it all
it seems allright
to find a place without a single life
where is the night
we run into

Cause nothing's good i can explain
i'm falling down and caught up the rain
i turn myself into changes
the night i kissed you goodbye
cause nothing's good i can explain
i'm falling down and caught up the rain
to turn myself into changes
your death is over

You wanna live a life pretty in scarlet
come on
you wanna wash it down i'm pretty in scarlet
to myself to say goodbye
you wanna live a life pretty in scarlet
come on
you wanna wash it down i'm pretty in scarlet
to myself to say

It's ok
doesn't count
for my place
deeper sound
let me dive alone
let me dive alone

You gave me wine
to poison me and take away my time
i can hear your cry
i wonder why

Cause nothing's good i can explain
i'm falling down and caught up the rain
cause i turn myself into changes
the night i kissed you goodbye
cause nothing's good i can explain
i'm falling down and caught up the rain
i turn myself into changes
your death is over

You wanna live a life pretty in scarlet
come on
you wanna wash it down i'm pretty in scarlet
to myself to say goodbye
you wanna live a life pretty in scarlet
come on
you wanna wash it down I'm pretty in scarlet
to myself to say goodbye

Pretty in scarlet
Pretty in scarlet
Pretty in scarlet

You wanna live a life pretty in scarlet
come on
you wanna wash it down I'm pretty in scarlet
(2x)

Pretty
she's pretty
she's pretty
and i run, and i run, and i run, and i run away

and if you throw a stone on me
and if you need some pain to see
and if you live your lies
I will run, will run, will run, run away

and if you throw a stone on me
and if you need some pain to see
and if you live your lies
I will run

Letra de Open Your Eyes :
Hide your face forever
dream and search forever

Have you ever been for sale ?
when your isms get smart
oh so selfish and mindless
with that comment in your eye

Do you think that you are hard ?
really harder than the other
man you're acting cold
if you are not in charge

Don't split your mentality
without thinking twice
your voice has got no reason
now is the time to face your lies

Open your eyes, open your mind
proud like a god don't pretend to be blind
trapped in yourself, break out instead
beat the machine that works in your head

Will you offer me some tricks
if I ever need them
would you go into that room
if I call 'em

Do you think that you are better
really better than the rest
realize there's a problem
I know that you can give your best

Have you ever had a dream?
or is life just a trip?
a trip without chances
a chance to grow up quick

Open your eyes, open your mind ...

Hide your face forever
dream and search forever
night and night you feel nothing
there's no way outside of my land

Open your eyes, open your mind ...

Letra de Decode :
How can I decide what's right?
When you're clouding up my mind
Can't win your losing fight all the time
Not gonna ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides
You wont take away my pride
No not this time
Not this time

How did we get here?
I use to know you so well
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know

The truth is hiding in your eyes
And its hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood,
But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are
If you're a man at all
Well, I will figure this one out on my own
(I'm screaming "I love you so..." But my thoughts you can't decode)

How did we get here?
I use to know you so well
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know

Do you see what we've done?
We're gonna make such fools of ourselves
Do you see what we've done?
We're gonna make such fools of ourselves

How did we get here?
I use to know you so well
How did we get here?
Well, I use to know you so well

I think I know
I think I know
There is something that I see in you
It might kill me I want it to be true

Letra de Hallelujah :
somehow everything's gonna fall right into place
if we only had a way to make it all fall faster everyday
if only time flew like a dove
we gotta make it fly faster than I'm falling in love

this time we're not giving up
let's make it last forever
screaming "hallelujah"
we'll make it last forever

holding onto patience, wearing thin
I can't force these eyes to see the end
if only time flew like a dove
we could watch it fly and just keep looking on

this time we're not giving up
let's make it last forever
screaming "hallelujah"
we'll make it last forever

and we've got time on our hands
and we've got, got nothing but time on our hands
got nothing but, got nothing but
got nothing but time on our hands

this time we're not giving up
oh, let's make it last forever
screaming "hallelujah"
"hallelujah"
"hallelujah"
