 With Arms Wide Open 


Well I just heard the news today 

It seems my life is going to change 

I closed my eyes, begin to pray 

Then tears of joy stream down my face 


With arms wide open 

Under the sunlight 

Welcome to this place 

I'll show you everything 

With arms wide open 

With arms wide open 


Well I don't know if I'm ready 

To be the man I have to be

I'll take a breath, I'll take her by my side 

We stand in awe, we've created life 


With arms wide open

Under the sunlight 

Welcome to this place 

I'll show you everything 

With arms wide open 

Now everything has changed 

I'll show you love 

I'll show you everything 

With arms wide open 

With arms wide open 

I'll show you everything ...oh yeah

With arms wide open..wide open 

[Guitar Break]


If I had just one wish 

Only one demand

I hope he's not like me 

I hope he understands 

That he can take this life 

And hold it by the hand 

And he can greet the world 

With arms wide open... 


With arms wide open

Under the sunlight 

Welcome to this place 

I'll show you everything 

With arms wide open 

Now everything has changed 

I'll show you love 

I'll show you everything 

With arms wide open 

With arms wide open 

I'll show you everything..oh yeah

With arms wide open....wide open

Torn



			Peace is what they tell me

Love am I unholy

Lies are what they tell me

Despise you that control me


The peace is dead in my soul

I have blamed the reasons for

My intentions poor

Yes I'm the one who

The only one who

Would carry on this far


Torn, I'm filthy

Born in my own misery

Stole all that you gave me

Control you claim you save me


The peace is dead in my soul

I have blamed the reasons for

My intentions poor

Yes I'm the one who

The only one who

Would carry on this far


Peace in my head

Love in my head

Lies lies lies lies in my head.


The peace is dead in my soul

I have blamed the reasons for

My intentions poor

Yes I'm the one who

The only one who

Would carry on this far


The peace is dead in my soul

I have blamed the reasons for

My intentions poor

Yes I'm the one who

The only one who

Would carry on this far

Ode


Hang me, watch awhile

Let me see you smile as I die

Take me, as my body burns

Let me see you yearn, while I cry


One step on your own

And you walk all over me

One head in the clouds

You won't let go

You're too proud

One light to the blind, and they see

One touch on the head, we believe


Adore me as I drift away

Let me hear you say I'm fine

You cry as my body dies

All that you despised is gone away


One step on your own

And you walk all over me

One head in the clouds

You won't let go, you're too proud

One light to the blind, and they see

One touch on the head, we believe

We believe 

[Guitar Break]


One step on your own

And you walk all over me

One head in the clouds

You won't let go, you're too proud

One light to the blind, and they see

One touch on the head, we believe

We believe

Creed - My Own Prison



A court is in session, a verdict is in

No appeal on the docket today

Just my own sin

The walls are cold and pale

The cage made of steel

Screams fill the room

Alone I drop and kneel

Silence now the sound

My breath the only motion around

Demons cluttering around

My face showing no emotion

Shackled by my sentence

Expecting no return

Here there is no penance

My skin begins to burn


(And I said oh) So I held my head up high

Hiding hate that burns inside

Which only fuels their selfish pride

(And I said oh) We're all held captive

Out from the sun

A sun that shines on only some

We the meek are all in one


I hear a thunder in the distance

See a vision of a cross

I feel the pain that was given

On that sad day of loss

A lion roars in the darkness

Only he holds the key

A light to free me from my burden

And grant me life eternally


Should have been dead

On a Sunday morning

Banging my head

No time for mourning

Ain't got no time


(And I said oh) So I held my head up high

Hiding hate that burns inside

Which only fuels their selfish pride

(And I said oh) We're all held captive

Out from the sun

A sun that shines on only some

We the meek are all in one

[Guitar break]


I cry out to God

Seeking only his decision

Gabriel stands and confirms

I've created my own prison

I cry out to God

Seeking only his decision

Gabriel stands and confirms

I've created my own prison


(And I said oh) So I held my head up high

Hiding hate that burns inside

Which only fuels their selfish pride

(And I said oh) We're all held captive

Out from the sun

A sun that shines on only some

We the meek are all in one


(And I said oh) So I held my head up high

Hiding hate that burns inside

Which only fuels their selfish pride

(And I said oh) We're all held captive

Out from the sun

A sun that shines on only some

We the meek are all in one


Should've been dead on a Sunday morning

banging my head

No time for mourning

Ain't got no time

 Higher



When dreaming I'm guided through another world

Time and time again

At sunrise I fight to stay asleep

'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place

'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape

From the life I live when I'm awake

So let's go there

Let's make our escape

Come on, let's go there

Let's ask can we stay?

Can you take me higher?

To the place where blind men see

Can you take me higher?

To the place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change

It helps me to appreciate

Those nights and those dreams

But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights

If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same

The only difference is

To let love replace all our hate

So let's go there

Let's make our escape

Come on, let's go there

Let's ask can we stay?

Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time

Up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams

And make them mine
