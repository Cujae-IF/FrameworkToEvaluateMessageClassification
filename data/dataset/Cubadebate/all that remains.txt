Letra de Before The Damned :

Let them hail the hollow one
Bow before the damned
Forge ahead into the night
Forget the lessons of the past
No remorse for the sinner
No repent for the waking dead
Hide their faces from the light
Let the past live again

We will set in motion
Changing of the times
We have not forgotten
We control our lives

Fallen feed on fallen now
Let the wretched have their fill
Feast not with the beast of old
Taste the fruit of ill will
We can band together now
Cast the dead from our site
Let them fall to massacre
Let the truth be our guide

Letra de Do Not Obey :

Never one to be held back or held down
I'd write my name so the king could see
I will follow the true declaration
And find some hope in what mankind could be

I've worked so hard
Let my deeds be my witness
And let my words flow through everyone
When free men stand
Against what would bind them
No hope for tyrants
We will over come

Do not obey
No masters now
Do not obey
Not subjects
We have held on for so long
Do not obey

Talking heads tell the masses the story
They shape the lie in the schools and the TV
Our fathers work and intent is unwritten
By the lazy who don't know they're free

I hear the story and it makes me determined
To spread the word that we can't just lay down
What we read and we see drawn before us
Is a lie and we must hold our ground

It's found in you
It's found in me
From birth to stone
We remain free as always
