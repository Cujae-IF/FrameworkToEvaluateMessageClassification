Afterlife(Avenged)

Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen so unsure but it seems, ’cause we’ve been waiting for you Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway I see a distant light, but girl this can't be right Such a surreal place to see so how did this come to be Arrived too early And when I think of all the places I just don't belong I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife ’Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain Can leave this place but refrain, ’cause we've been waiting for you Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway This peace on earth's not right (with my back against the wall) No pain or sign of time (I’m much too young to fall) So out of place don't wanna stay, I feel wrong and that's my sign I've made up my mind Gave me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife ’Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you This place full of peace and light, and I’d hope you might take me back inside when the time is right Loved ones back home all crying ’cause they're already missing me I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be (I am unbroken; I’m choking on this ecstasy) Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me (Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live) I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife ’Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you This place full of peace and light, and I’d hope you might take me back inside when the time is right

Dear God (Avenged)

A lonely road, crossed another cold state line Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find While I recall all the words you spoke to me Can't help but wish that I was there Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah Dear God the only thing I ask of you is to hold her when I'm not around, when I'm much too far away We all need that person who can be true to you But I left her when I found her And now I wish I'd stayed ’Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired I'm missing you again oh no Once again There's nothing here for me on this barren road There's no one here while the city sleeps and all the shops are closed Can't help but think of the times I've had with you Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah Dear God the only thing I ask of you is to hold her when I'm not around, when I'm much too far away We all need that person who can be true to you I left her when I found her And now I wish I'd stayed ’Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired I'm missing you again oh no Once again Some search, never finding a way Before long, they waste away I found you, something told me to stay I gave in, to selfish ways And how I miss someone to hold when hope begins to fade... A lonely road, crossed another cold state line Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find Dear God the only thing I ask of you is to hold her when I'm not around, when I'm much too far away We all need the person who can be true to you I left her when I found her And now I wish I'd stayed ’Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired I'm missing you again oh no Once again

Now we're broken, here I stand alone 
Wondering what were the last words I said to you

Breathe Life


And it begins a new)? 
the hatred of mankind 
as it seeks to kill 
()? 
now we are dying 
dying the slowest death 
held down by bonds that bind us 
we breathe a final breath 

(and it begins a new)? 
the burning we endure 
as we seek the strength 
strength to break the bonds 

now we are dying 
dying the slowest death 
no more (calculation)? 
we fight for one last breath 

breathe life, for you are not alone 
breathe life, inside your heart of stone 

from dust you were born 
into the ashes you return 
from dust you were born 
into the ashes you return 

break the bonds 
break the bonds 

breathe life, for you are not alone 
breathe life, inside your heart of stone (breathe in life) 
breathe life, for you are not alone (breathe life, breathe in life) 
breathe life, inside your heart of stone

Goodbye To You(breaking point)


There's so much I want to say now 
but it's too late i know 
There's no way to heal these wounds now 
and my heart bleeds for you 

And our love is crashing 
like a tidal wave 
coming over me 

CHORUS: 
So I wanted you to know 
that i finally let you go 
After all i've held on to 
This is my goodbye to you 
I was always there for you 
but you never saw the truth 
and the reason that i know 
is i've finally let you go 

Yesterday you were my best friend 
but tomorrow took you away 
There's not much for me to say now 
Just goodbye, farewell 

And our love is crashing 
like a tidal wave 
coming over me 

CHORUS 

And every time i close my eyes 
my heart is bleeding deep inside 
but now my eyes are open 
and i'm never gonna be the one for you 
the one for you

Don't Let Go(breaking point)


I see the future not the past 
i won't let go i'll make this last 
i won't give up, i'll find a way 
the same old faces haunting me 
but i won't let them control me 
i'm good enough and i'm strong enough 

CHORUS: 
So don't let go 
just hold on tightly 
i won't give up until i find a way 
i'm at the end of the road 
there's no turning back now 
i've come too far, i'm only miles away 

i'm looking deep inside myself 
searching for the one way out 
cause i won't let this slip away 
so every night i hope and pray 
knowing that i'll find a way 
i won't give up, no i won't give up 

CHORUS 

So just look into my eyes 
and try to read my mind 
explore all the treasures locked in me 
so just look into my eyes 
then you'd realize 
that you're the one who's haunting me

I've come too far 
I'm only miles away

Nothing Left At All(breaking point)


It's so ugly inside here 
i'm trapped here 
i cannot leave this place 
everything is all changing and fading 
and i want to escape 
but just when i thought i'd found a way out 
i fall right on my face 

CHORUS: 
So don't wait too late 
to see that they take til there's nothing 
nothing left at all 
we live to give ourselves away 
but they take til there's nothing left at all 

is there anyone out there 
to hear me 
hear me crying out 
cause i need someone to show me 
the reality of what i've got to face 
but just when i finally start to wake up 
i find out it's too late 

CHORUS 

why can't they hear us 
why can't they see 
cause we're crying out for something 
something to believe 

CHORUS 

don't wait too late to see that we're fighting for something 
something that's already gone 
today i gave myself away 
and i'm left here with nothing 
nothing left at all
