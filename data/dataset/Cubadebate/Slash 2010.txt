LETRA DE LA CANCION SLASH - STARLIGHT (FEAT. MYLES KENNEDY) (SLASH)

In the distance light years from tomorrow
Far beyond yesterday
She is watching, heart aching with sorrow
She is broken , as she waits
Hoping when all is said and done we can learn to love and be as one

[Chorus]
Oh Starlight, don't you cry we gonna make it right before tomorrow
Oh Starlight, don't you cry we're gonna find a place where we belong (where we belong)
And so you know, we'll never shine alone

There are shadows sleeping on the horizon
Leave us scared and so afraid
As the fall out of a world divided
It brings her tears and so much pain
And so we take cover from the dark
Hoping to find where we can start

[Chorus]
Oh Starlight, don't you cry we gonna make it right before tomorrow
Oh Starlight, don't you cry we're gonna find a place where we belong (where we belong)
And so you know, you'll never shine alone
Starlight we'll find a place where we belong

You will see when the mountains fall and turn to dust
There's one thing that can't change
I believe there's something within each over us that always says
That will always remain as long as love never pains

[Chorus]
Oh Starlight, don't you cry we gonna make it right before tomorrow
Oh Starlight, don't you cry we're gonna find a place where we belong (where we belong)
And so you know, you'll never shine alone
Starlight we'll find a place where we belong (we belong)

She is watching, heart aching with sorrow
She is broken is broken, as she waits

Letra de Paradise City :
(feat. Cypress Hill, Fergie)


Just an urchin living under the street
I'm a hard case, real tough to beat
I'm your charity case
So buy me something to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Rags to riches or so they say
You got to keep pushing for the fortune and fame you know it
It's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doing their time

Take me down
To the Paradise City
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd smoke another cigarette but I can't see
Tell me who you're going to believe

Take me down
To the Paradise City
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home

Take me down
To the Paradise City
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

So far away (4x)

Captain America's been torn apart now
he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said -
"Turn me around and take me back to the start"
I must be losing my mind -
"Are you blind?!"
I've seen it all a million times

Take me down
To the Paradise City
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home

Take me down
To the Paradise City
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

I want to go
I want to know
Oh, won't you please take me home

I want to see
Oh, look at me
Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down
To the Paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home

Take me down
To the Paradise City
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

Take me down
Beat me down
Oh, won't you please take me home

I want to see
Oh, look at me
Oh, won't you please take me home

I want to see
Boy, I'm going to be mean
Oh, oh take me home

Take me down
To the Paradise City
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

I want to go
I want to know
Oh, won't you please take me home
Yeah, baby
Yeah
